hypothesis Testing
Definition:
Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to make decisions using data from a sample. The goal is to determine whether there is enough evidence in a sample of data to infer that a certain condition is true for the entire population.
 Steps in Hypothesis Testing:
I. State the Hypotheses:
• Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no effect or difference, and it represents a statement of "no change or "no difference."
• Alternative Hypothesis (H1 or Ha): Contradicts the null hypothesis and represents a statement Of "there is an effect" or "there is a difference."
II. Choose a significance level(aplha)
III. Collect data and compute a test statistic
IV. Determine the P-value
V. Make a decision

Types of tests:
1. Z-test
2. T-test
3. ANOVA
4. Chi-square test
