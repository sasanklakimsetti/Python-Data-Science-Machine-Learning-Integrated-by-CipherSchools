Inferential Statistics

Key concepts:
1. Population and Sample:
* Population: The entire group that you want to draw conclusions about.
* Sample: A subset of the population that is used to represent the entire group.

Estimation:
• Point Estimation: Involves using sample data to estimate an unknown population parameter (e.g., population mean or proportion).
• Interval Estimation (Confidence Intervals): Instead of a single point estimate, an interval estimation provides a range within which the parameter is expected to lie, with a certain degree of confidence (typically 95% or 99%).

Common Point Estimators:
• Sample Mean as an estimator for the Population Mean
• Sample Proportion as an estimator for the Population Proportion.
• Sample Variance as an estimator for the Population Variance
Example:
If you have a sample of students' scores from a class test, and you calculate the average score from this sample, that average (sample mean) is a point estimate of the population mean score, assuming the sample is representative Of the entire class.

Components Of Confidence Intervals:
• Confidence Level: Typically expressed as a percentage (e.g., 95% or 99%), the confidence level
indicates the probability the confidence interval computed from a sample contains the true
population parameter.
• Margin Of Error: The range above and below the point estimate that the actual parameter is
expected to fall within.
